# KISTools

This is a very simple dumbed down app I made as a Personal Project for my school(KIS). It has really simple functions like a built-in calculator and quite a simple notes app.

The highlight of this app is the schedule system that it has, it sends notifications to a user 10 mins before their next class so they can get ready for it. It's still in very early versions as this is a prototype of what is to come ahead. I have used firebase as the backend system.

Now a huge problem is I am getting back to this app after what is nearly a year as I left it alone. This app is now riddled with errors and won't even run. I have uploaded it to GitHub for my convinience so I can get working on it anywhere. If any of you have some suggestions or things to change please do suggest them and I will most definitely look into it.

Thank You!
